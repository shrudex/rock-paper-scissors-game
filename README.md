The two selections will then be compared, and the winner will be displayed on the screen with an animated transition effect. If you win, the background of the game container will display a Patrick Batman Sigma video. If you lose, the background of the game container will display a sad Jethalal video. In the case of a tie, the background will turn black. The handshake animation will play whenever you make a selection.
